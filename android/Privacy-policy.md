# Privacy Policy

The [Wikimedia Commons Android] app is a free, open-source app developed by grantees and volunteers of the Wikimedia community to allow users to upload content to [Wikimedia Commons]. This APPLICATION is provided by members of the Wikimedia community and is intended for use as is. 

This Policy is used to inform users regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information. If you choose to use the Wikimedia Commons Android app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy.

### Information Collection and Use

While using our Application, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your username, location and pictures stored on your phone. Images that you upload to Wikimedia Commons via our Application will be publicly viewable on Wikimedia Commons along with your username, the location of the image (if geotagging is enabled) and associated image data. Aside from that, the information that we request is retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way. 

The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you. 

### first-party Service Providers

We use Mapbox map servers in order to provide the "Nearby places that need photos" feature in our Application. We want to inform users of this Application that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.


> When a mobile application uses Mapbox SDKs, it may send to Mapbox certain limited location and usage data along with an ephemeral ID. We also use a more stable ID for the limited purpose of tracking the number of monthly active users connected to our developer customers. If we collect location data, we do not associate it with any identifying information, including names, permanent IDs, email addresses, IP addresses, or phone numbers. You can find more information about how we secure and use location data on our telemetry page.


### Image EXIF data

Images uploaded to Wikimedia Commons via this Application will NOT be stripped of EXIF metadata that may contain (but is not limited to) image location, date taken, phone manufacturer and model, and camera settings. All of this metadata will be visible on Wikimedia Commons along with the image. If a user desires to strip an image of EXIF metadata, it is recommended that this be done prior to uploading.
