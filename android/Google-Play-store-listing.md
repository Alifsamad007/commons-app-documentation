# Google Play store listing

## New Listing (2017):

[I am drawing heavily on our website for this, thanks Tobias!]

Join one of the largest photo and multimedia communities in the world! Commons is not only the image repository for [[Wikipedia]], but an independent project that seeks to document the world with photos, videos and recordings.

Features:
- Upload photos to Commons directly from your smartphone
- Categorize your photos to make them easier for other people to find
- Automatic category suggestions based on photo location data and title
- View nearby missing images - this helps Wikipedia to have images for all articles, and you will discover beautiful places close to you
- View all the contributions you have made to Commons in one gallery

Using the app is easy:
- Install
- Log in to your Wikimedia account (if you don't have an account, create one for free at this step)
- Select 'From Gallery' (or the picture icon)
- Select the picture that you wish to upload to Commons
- Enter a title and description for the picture
- Select the license that you wish to release your picture under 
- Enter as many relevant categories as possible
- Press Save

The following guidelines will help you to understand what photos the community is looking for:
[The tick and cross icons seem to work in the Google Play text editor, but will have to re-draft this part if they don't]  
✓ Photos that document the world around you - famous people, political events, festivals, monuments, landscapes, natural objects and animals, food, architecture, etc  
✓ Photos of notable objects that you find in the Nearby List in the app  
✖ Copyrighted pictures  
✖ Photos of you or your friends. But if you are documenting an event it doesn't matter if they are in the picture  
✖ Photos of poor quality. Make sure the things you are trying to document are visible on the picture

This is a community-maintained, open-source app run by volunteers (and one Wikimedia grantee). New volunteers are always welcome, not just for coding, but also for testing, design, documentation, user education, etc. Come join us!

## Old Listing (2015):

> Be the witness of your world: Take pictures of interesting monuments, objects, events, and send them to Wikipedia's images database, where volunteers can use them immediately to illustrate relevant articles.

> Please only upload pictures that you took yourself and that have educational or historical or encyclopedic value.
> No selfies, no images downloaded from the Internet.
> Very welcome: Pictures of famous people, rare things, political events, festivals, monuments, landscapes, architecture, etc.

> Please enter a meaningful title and relevant categories for every image you upload. At least, describe what the picture shows and where it was taken. This will make your pictures more easily findable by [[Wikipedia editors]]. Pictures without a meaningful title and tags may be deleted.

> GPS-geocoded pictures are much more valuable. Please use an app like "google" to automatically add GPS latitude/longitude to your pictures.
